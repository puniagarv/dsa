/*Intuition
as we know the smallest for overlapping condition circle and rectangle must touch each other or cut each other try to find the closest point on rectangle to the circle and compare to its radius if radius is lesser than distance between center of the circle and the point then they never collide

Approach
first check the position of the circle with respect to the rectangle min(xcenter,x2)
find the point which is closest by max(x1,min(xcenter,x2))
Do same for y
Complexity
Time complexity:
o(1)

Space complexity:
o(1)

       // we check the position of the circle in form of x cordinate comparision 
       //we check the center of circle is lie on which side of the rectangle 
       //according to the side of we find the closest point
